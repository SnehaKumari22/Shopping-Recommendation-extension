# Shopping-Recommendation-extension
A chrome extension that allows user to crop product on the website or video and displays similar product recommendation and purchase links for it.

Our intelligent recommendation system aims to provide a seamless experience for our users to shop for any product they see and like on the web with a single click. The system will recommend products that are visually most similar to the user’s desired product along with the price and the website that hosts the recommended products.

### What is the problem that a customer faces?
While surfing the internet or watching our favorite OTT shows, we often desire to imitate the same look. But the hassle of digging through the web and shopping websites kills this wish. The traditional way to go around this is to jam the google search bar with the most relevant keywords we can come up with. Such efforts rarely yield optimal results. Also, the process of taking a screenshot, cropping the image, and uploading it to Google Images is cumbersome. The proposed recommendation system strives to mitigate this problem and deliver a solution that satisfies the user with wishful outcomes.

### What can be done to solve that problem?
We propose a novel recommendation system where a user while surfing the web, can click on the snip icon, crop the item of interest and get recommendations of the products that are visually most similar to the cropped item. Along with the recommendations, the user will also get information about each recommended product's price, description, and the list of websites they can buy the product from. Clicking on the products will redirect the user to the shopping site which hosts these products. It also alleviates the inconvenience to remember and search for the product. Thus, with minimal effort, a user can connect to the website that sells these products. Our recommendation system can set in motion a new shopping behavior among customers and also increase revenues for sellers.

### Project Plan
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our business would be an apparel recommendation engine with the following features:

Click on one of the recommended items from the list.
Navigate to the shopping website and start shopping!
